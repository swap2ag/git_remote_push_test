first commit mesage
created README.md file on remote
Created file2.txt on local and simply did git pull without staging or committing any changes-> No problem (git pull just worked fine :) )

Again making changes on remote, and this time, going to create a different file and make changes to it and staging it in local -> -> No problem (git pull just worked fine :) )

Again making changes on remote, and this time, going to create a different file and make changes to it and commit it in local -> Since the file changed was different, so merge was made at local and a commit was automatically done by git to reflect that merge operation.

Now, 
Going to make changes to remote which is one commit behind local and then commit those changes. Then at local, trying to use git push origin master.      -> while pushing from local, it said that remote had some changes, and so need to first pull those changes. When I pulled the changes, since local had commit not which remote didn't have, so there was again a merge commit done at local.

Now, need to push this merge commit to remote as well, so that both are in sync. Then I will commit this line at the remote. This operation completed successfully.


Now, Making changes in below line (in the next commit) after pulling upto current line in local.
