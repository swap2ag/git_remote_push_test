first commit mesage
created README.md file on remote
Created file2.txt on local and simply did git pull without staging or committing any changes-> No problem (git pull just worked fine :) )

Again making changes on remote, and this time, going to create a different file and make changes to it and staging it in local -> -> No problem (git pull just worked fine :) )

Again making changes on remote, and this time, going to create a different file and make changes to it and commit it in local -> Since the file changed was different, so merge was made at local and a commit was automatically done by git to reflect that merge operation.

Now, 
Going to make changes to remote which is one commit behind local and then commit those changes. Then at local, trying to use git push origin master.
