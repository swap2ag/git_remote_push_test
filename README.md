# git_remote_push_test
repo for testing merge conflicts between remote and local

I am testing the merge conflicts that can arise between remote and local branches.

Scenario 1 - If remote has made some changes to a file and local also makes changes in the same lines of the file, then
If we push from remote, what needs to be done?

Scenario 2 - If remote has made some changes to a file and local also makes changes in the same lines of the file, then
If we push to remote, what needs to be done?

For further details, see file.txt. It contains my observations and understanding about merge conflicts and detailed description of above scenario
